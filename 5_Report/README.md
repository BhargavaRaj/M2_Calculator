# M2_Calculator
## Introduction
Calculator, In this project the designed embedded system has been created.The circuit had being developed on simulIDE software platform by 
using Atmega328p microcontroller.In this project calculator has been made to perform addition, substraction, multiplication and division.

## Features
-   It is easier to get calculation in this project .
-   The expressions used are for addition "+",substraction "-",multiplication "*",and division "/" .
-   LCD display will show you the calculations done by you .
